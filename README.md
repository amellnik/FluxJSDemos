# FluxJSDemos

This is a website to showcase the [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) machine learning library.  All demos are based on models developed and trained in Julia with Flux and then exported to [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org/) via [FluxJS](https://github.com/FluxML/FluxJS.jl).  

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.  Please refer to the Angular CLI documentation for instructions on how to run it locally, scaffold components, and build it for deployment.
